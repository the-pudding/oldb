He got a good estate by merchandise and, leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption of words in England we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name “Crusoe,” and so my companions always called me.","Robinson Crusoe","Daniel Defoe","fiction,historyhistoricalfictionbiography,youngadult,children,fantasyparanormal,classics,fiction,adventure,literature,historicalfiction,novels,classicliterature,18thcentury,school,britishliterature","0"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
